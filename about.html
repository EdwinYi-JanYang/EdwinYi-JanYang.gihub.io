                    <h1>Thanks for visiting my website</h1>
                    <p style="font-size:25px">My name is Edwin Yi-Jan Yang, and I am a third year student at the University of Waterloo.
                        <br>I believe one of the truest joys in life is learning about the ingenious ways things work, and then being able to apply that knowledge to benefit society.
                        <br>I love all sorts of things, including computer science, space, new groundbreaking technologies, and even graphic design and psychology.
                        <br>All of humanities knowledge is at our fingertips, and meeting passionate people and talking about their experiences is something I enjoy.
                        <br>I love working with a team to hash out difficult problems, I find it very rewarding.
                        <br>I am very motivated, and I am not afraid to fail on my way to accomplishing my academic, social, and physical goals.
                        <br>Further, people who know me well describe me as being an individual sensitive to the needs and welfare of others,
                        <br>because in building each other up we can achieve things one person simply cannot.
